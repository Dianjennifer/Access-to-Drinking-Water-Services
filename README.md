## Project Overview
### United Nations SDGs Overview
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are an ongoing global call to action to end poverty, ensure prosperity and peace for all people, and protect our planet. There are 17 goals relating to poverty, health, education, basic services, inequality, climate, peace, and partnership.

### UN SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Due to changes in our climate, droughts are becoming more prevalent, and water supplies are decreasing worldwide. This not only affects access to drinking water but also sanitation and hygiene, often resulting in unnecessary diseases and death. To ensure greater access to water and sanitation, communities across the world need to assist each other in developing and managing water resources.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (JMP). The JMP dataset estimates household access to drinking water services between 2000 and 2020 to assess progress toward achieving the sixth SDG

## Data Preparation and Cleaning
The dataset was cleaned using Google Sheets to ensure consistency and remove any irrelevant or erroneous data. The cleaning process involved tasks such as:

* Removing duplicate entries
* Handling missing values
* Standardizing data formats
* Correcting data inconsistencies
* Checking for outlier

## Data Analysis
The cleaned dataset was subjected to various data analysis techniques to extract insights related to access to drinking water. The analysis included:

+ Descriptive statistics to summarize key metrics such as population served, access levels, and disparities.
+ Visualization techniques such as charts and graphs to illustrate trends and patterns in the data.
+ Comparative analysis to identify differences in access levels among different countries and regions.
+ Correlation analysis to explore relationships between access to drinking water and various socio-economic factors
